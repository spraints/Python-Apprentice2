# Hotel Management

The purpose of this program is to make sure you have an understanding of the
topics you learned in Python Apprentice.  This is going to be your 1st program
you write all by yourself, imagine someone hired you to create a hotel
management program.

## Getting Started:
* Under projects create a new file and name it hotel_management.py
* Create a docstring (it's the triple quotes “””  stuff goes inside “””)
* Take some time to organize your thoughts on how the program will be laid out
  and what you will need (functions, imports, loops, etc.)
* Write down your thoughts as a list or instructions to yourself inside the docstring
* Add your imports (Tkinter or whatever you need)
* Code away, make sure to keep it organized so you know where things are and
  what they do.
  * Separate different functionalities into their own functions.


## Requirements:
* Should run in 1 While Loop
* Nearly all functionality should be in functions which are called from a
  `main()` function.
* The functions should, mostly, return something
  * For instance if I had a function called add, it should return the sum rather
    than just doing the operation or printing it.
    * Remember, with Python you can set a variable to a return value of a
      function, so:  my_age = add(10, 5)
* Add arguments to your functions as needed
* Must contain and iterate over these data structures:
  * List
  * Dictionary
  * Tuple

## Functionality Requirements:
* Must be interactive, either in the command line with print() and input() or
  with Tkinter
* Check guests in and out
* Charge guests for their room(s)
* Multiple room check in
* Multiple Night Check in
* Add 1 new feature of your choice
  * Ex.  Upgrade room, room service, spa package, etc.  


Have Fun!!!
